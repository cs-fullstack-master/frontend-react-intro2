### Exercise 1
Create a new component called Netflix from App.js. In Netflix create an array of collections for movies. Include movieName, yearReleased, and genre for three collections. Pass that array of collections to a child component, DisplayMovies. In DisplayMovies, return each element's key in any way you like.

### Exercise 2
Create a new create-react-app program. Create a new StudentAccount, FirstName, and LastName component. The StudentAccount component should call the FirstName and LastName components inside of it. Pass a firstName and lastName props to StudentAccount, then pass the firstName and lastName props to the FirstName and LastName components to use in p tags.
